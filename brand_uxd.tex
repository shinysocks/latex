% Title Page

\begin{itemize}
    \item Brand A: RumbleFit is branded to have a tough-love personality which makes sense as it is designed to motivate you.
    \item Brand C: JoyPet is certainly branded but feels over the top and not necessary
    \item Brand B: ClarityBank also does not have particular branding for interaction which may also not be necessary for a bank
    \item Brand D: TechNest lacks personality and confirms the interaction but doesn't add any branding.
\end{itemize}
