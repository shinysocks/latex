What insights did you gain from the video and readings?
\begin{itemize}
    \item interesting that storyboards are also used in films and tv shows
    \item it is important to consider all perspectives, not just your own, in the case of TedTalk,
           Dietz didn't consider the perspective of a fearful child.
    \item storyboards do not require artistic talent
\end{itemize}

What aspects of journey mapping and storyboarding stood out to you as valuable design tools?
\begin{itemize}
    \item journey map can reveal user's experience when interacting with a product
    \item creating customer persona to model a theoretical customer's interactions
    \item storyboarding can convey a surprising amount of user emotion
\end{itemize}

How can you apply storyboards and journey maps to develop better design ideas?
\begin{itemize}
    \item applying storyboards improves your ability to empathize with users when designing
    \item make more human centered designs
    \item make designs more accessible to different groups
\end{itemize}

How did Doug Dietzâ€™s experience with MRI machines change your perspective on human-centered design in healthcare?
\begin{itemize}
    \item machines used by so many different types of people must be comfortable
    \item I haven't really considered comfort / emotion for medical equipment ux
\end{itemize}

Provide an example: If you were designing a healthcare product or service, how would you use these tools to improve the user experience?
\begin{itemize}
    \item example
\end{itemize}

What challenges do you think designers might face when implementing these methods?
\begin{itemize}
    \item designers may lack artistic talent and struggle to put their ideas into a storyboard
    \item designers may have difficulty creating accurate personas for their users
\end{itemize}
